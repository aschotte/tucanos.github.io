# Metric

A metric field is used in order to prescribe the element sizes and orientations to be used during remeshing. The continuous mesh framework establishes a duality between this (continuous) metric field and the resulting discrete mesh : for more details, see A. Loseille and F. Alauzet, *Continuous mesh framework. Part I: well-posed continuous interpolation error*, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., Vol. 49, Issue 1, pp. 38-60, 2011.
