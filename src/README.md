Tucanos is a 2D and 3D anisotropic mesh adaptation library based on [*Four-Dimensional Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation for
Spacetime Numerical Simulations* by
Philip Claude Caplan](https://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~pcaplan/docs/Caplan_2019_PhD.pdf).

Pytucanos is the python wrapper and it can be found [here](https://github.com/tucanos/pytucanos).

This document briefly presents the theory behind the remesher, as some aspects are new to other remesher.
